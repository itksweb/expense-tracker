## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

```js
const grad = {
  background: `linear-gradient(to right , ${color1}, ${color2})`,
};
```

### Continued development

Hope to apply and improve on these principles in more advanced projects that have to do with theme switching
